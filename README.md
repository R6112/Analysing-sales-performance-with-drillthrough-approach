 The dashboard utilizes a combination of stacked bar charts, drill-through functionality, and bookmarks to provide interactive insights.

**Page 1: Sales Summary**

**Overview:**

This page presents a high-level summary of sales performance across different product categories.
A stacked bar chart displays the total sales for each product category, allowing for easy comparison.
Drill-Through Functionality:
Clicking on a specific product category (e.g., Mountain Bikes) in the stacked bar chart initiates a drill-through action.
The stacked bar chart on this page dynamically updates to display the sales performance of the selected product category across different months.
This allows for a deeper dive into the sales trends for the chosen category.

**Page 2: Sales Detail**

**Overview:**

This page provides detailed sales information, focusing on customer location and order totals.
A stacked bar chart presents the sales distribution across different customer locations.
Drill-Through Integration:
This page is linked to Page 1 through the drill-through functionality.
When a product category is selected on Page 1, this page automatically updates to reflect the sales details for the chosen category.
This ensures that the analysis remains consistent across both pages.

**Bookmarks**

The dashboard utilizes bookmarks to save specific views and configurations.
Bookmarks can be created for:
Pre-defined product category selections on Page 1.
Specific date ranges or filters applied to the charts.
Customized layouts and visualizations.
This feature allows users to quickly navigate to their preferred views and easily share specific insights with colleagues.
